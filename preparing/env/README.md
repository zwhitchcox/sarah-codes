## Setting up your environment

Now, let's get prepared to actually code.

### Editor

We don't write code in in Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or anything like that. These are "rich text" editors. They add a bunch of stuff like styling to the words, which would confuse the computer.

Instead, we use a code editor.

We will be using VS Code, an editor written by Microsoft in Javascript that can run on pretty much anything.

It's basically built on top of a web browser, but altered to be able to do anything a regular program can do.
