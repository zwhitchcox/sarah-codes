### Git

Now that we have a place to write a our code, we need to be able to save it.

But when you save it, it's nice to be able to go back to a previous revision.

Also, if you lose your computer or accidentally overwrite delete your files, it's good to have a backup saved in the cloud.

You also might need to collaborate and merge other people's code into your own.

All these things and more are done through `git`, a program written by the same guy who write `linux`, Linus Torvalds.

Download and install git from https://git-scm.com/downloads

And create an account a https://github.com

Then go through the git book: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

This is an invaluable tool for programming. Make sure you play around with it and aren't just reading it. Make it fun!
