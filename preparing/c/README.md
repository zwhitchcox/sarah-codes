### C

The final preparation is to go through the book, the C programming language by Dennis Ritchie. It was written in the 70s and still used to this day.

This will give you a fundamental understanding of programming and what the computer is doing underneath the hood.

Almost all modern languages are derived from C, and many important programs, including the Linux Kernel and git are written in C.

You probably won't use this very much day-to-day though.
