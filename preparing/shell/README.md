### Shell

When you're writing code, you don't typically use a graphical user interface (GUI) to interact with the computer, but through the `shell`.

The "shell" or "terminal" is how all interactions were done until Apple and Microsoft came out with their GUIs, which they both stole from Xerox labs.

Interacting through the shell is much faster than using a GUI and also enables you to write programs for tasks and execute programs without having to open a window.

Most programming tools actually don't have GUI versions, so getting comfortable with the shell is pretty valuable.

A popular shell language is `bash`. Bash is the sucessor of `sh`, which had a more limited instruction set. `bash` stands for "bourne again shell", because `sh` was called the "Bourne Shell". Get used to little puns like these if you're going to be a programmer.

Go to https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Introduction.html and follow along the tutorial to get comfortable with bash.

Make sure you PLAY AROUND with everything as you're learning it. Don't just read, actually try things out. Try to break it. Test theories. Make it fun!

### Other tools

There are a few more fundamental tools you will need when programming. These are important, because you won't always have access to a GUI, like when you're accessing a server.

#### Vim

Vim is probably already installed on your computer. Go to your terminal and type `vimtutor` which will give you a tutorial on using `vim`. This is a terminal-based text editor

#### Tmux

tmux is kind of like a GUI built into the terminal. Go to https://tmuxguide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tmux/tmux.html and learn how to use tmux
