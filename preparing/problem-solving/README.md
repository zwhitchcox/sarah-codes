### Problem Solving

In general, when you run into an issue follow the "Answer Steps" to find a solution.

If you encounter a dependency on the solution, follow the "Dependency Steps".

#### Answer Steps

If at any point you find a solution return to the dependent.

1. Google the problem for a quick solution.
1. Google will typically give you a question/answer forum like https://stackoverflow.com with questions related to what you googled.
1. Programmers typically write documentation or "docs" for technology they create, kind of like an instruction manual. Look at the docs for the technology you're using for a solution.
1. If the technology is "open source", meaning they publish their code online, look at the source code for the technology you are using.
1. Ask a friend if you know anyone who might have an answer for you
1. Post on a forum
1. Go back to step 1 and retry everything. Typically what you've learned along the way will help you find a solution.


#### Dependency Steps

1. If the dependency is some technology/term you're unfamiliar with, just try to guess what it means from context.
1. Open a new tab or window and follow the new issue's "Answer Steps"
1. If there is a circular dependency, still open a new tab or window, don't go back to the previous window, or you will lose your place when you return.
1. Upon finding a solution close the tabs and return to the original problem
