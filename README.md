### Sarah Codes

This is a repo dedicated to teaching my bear, Sarah, to code.

For the unitiated, Sarah and I are a family of bears living in a cave with our cub, Penelope.

*Note: This website is designed for bears, but humans are welcome to follow along. Just be aware, that there may be some bear-specific concepts that humans won't relate to.*

What follows are modules for her to complete to become a genu-wine code bear.

#### Web Development

We're starting with web development, because the web provides an easy virtualized environment where we can explore all the different concepts of programming as well as create something cool.

This is a fundamentally useful thing to learn as well as being a stepping stone to other forms of programming like native app development (not virtualized).
