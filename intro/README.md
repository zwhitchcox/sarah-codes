## Intro

I am a self-taught code bear, meaning that I did not go to school for it or have any formal training at all. This meant I had to learn to be resourceful and use the web as my teacher. This is a valuable skillset in and of itself and one that I still rely on every day.

So, as you progress through these modules, try to look stuff up on your own. It may take you down a different path, but don't be afraid of going down rabbit holes. A wide breadth of knowledge to draw from will help you to become a better coder.
